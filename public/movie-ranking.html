<h1>The Best Movies According to Emily</h1>
<h2>Unequivocally the best three movies according to a very scientific process (my own feelings and opinions)</h2>

    <li><h3>Spirited</h3>
        <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E3MWRiMjYtMjM2Yi00ZDJiLTgwZDctMjk2ZWQ0NjQyYzliXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg" alt="Cover of Spirited" height="200">
    <p>Expertly choreographed. Incredible score. Riotously funny. What more could you ask for from a made-for-TV musical?</p></li>
    <li><h3>Cars 3</h3>

    <p>It's a classic coming-of-age story retold for those learning to be teachers and celebrate the accomplishments of the next generation.</p></li>
    <li><h3>The Princess Bride</h3>
        <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611zeTfBpoL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg" alt="The Princess Bride cover" height="200">
    <p>This is the film that inspired my own love story. I walked down the aisle to Storybook Love. It's got everything in one movie: Adventure, Wit, Romance, Humor... It truly is a gem.</p></li>
